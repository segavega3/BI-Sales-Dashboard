## Dataset Overview
This project uses an **online sales dataset** sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samruddhi4040/online-sales-data?select=Orders.csv)**.  
It contains **customer orders and transaction details** from **all 12 months of 2018**.

### Dataset Summary
| **Table Name**    | **Rows** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------|----------------|
| **orders**       | 500     | Customer & order metadata (who, when, where). |
| **order_details** | 1500    | Transaction details (what was sold, how much, payment type). |

**License:** CC0: Public Domain  

---

## Database Schema
The dataset follows a **one-to-many relationship** between the `orders` and `order_details` tables:
- **`Order ID`** is the **Primary Key (PK)** in both tables.
- The **`orders` table** contains order **metadata**.
- The **`order_details` table** contains **sales and transaction details**.

```
## Data Exploration & Key Insights

### Orders Table Insights
- **25 distinct cities** across **19 states**.
- **336 unique customers**, with **107 customers appearing more than once**.
- **307 distinct order dates**â€”further validation required to ensure completeness.
- **500 distinct `Order ID`s**, all present in both tables.

#### Analysis Test:
- How many **distinct `Order ID`s** are associated with the **336 customers**?
- Do duplicate `Order ID`s on the same day indicate **multi-item purchases**?

### Order Details Table Insights
- **3 main product categories**: Clothing, Electronics, Furniture.
- **17 total sub-categories**, distributed as:
  - **Furniture:** 4 sub-categories.
  - **Clothing:** 9 sub-categories.
  - **Electronics:** 4 sub-categories.
- **1500 total order entries but only 500 distinct `Order ID`s**, suggesting multiple items per order.
- **5 payment methods**: COD, UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card, EMI.

#### Analysis Test:
- Validate that **all 500 `Order ID`s in `order_details` match the 500 IDs in `orders`**.

---

## **Final Insights & Actionable Steps**
1. **Identify the reasons for high negative profits in Q2 and Q3.**  
   - Are specific **products** driving losses?  
   - Were there **pricing errors, discounts, or refunds** impacting margins?  

2. **Analyze why December, despite high sales, had a negative profit margin.**  
   - Were **excessive holiday discounts** the reason?  
   - Did **expensive products underperform** during the season?  

3. **Further investigate states with high negative profit orders.**  
   - Should pricing be adjusted regionally?  
   - Are certain cities consistently unprofitable?  

4. **Compare products sold in profitable months vs. unprofitable months.**  
   - Identify the **best-performing products** and **phase out low-margin items**.
  
5. **Reevaluate Clothing Profitability Across Quarters**
   - Clothing had **negative profits in Q2 and Q3** despite moderate sales, indicating pricing or discounting issues.
   - Consider reducing **markdowns** or identifying **high-cost, low-profit items** within this category.

6. **Leverage Electronics as a High-Performing Category**
   - **Electronics had the highest profits in Q1 and Q4**, suggesting **seasonal demand trends**.
   - Further analyze which **products within Electronics** contributed most to profitability.

7. **Investigate Poor-Performing Product Types**
   - **Phones in Q3 (-$2,114)** and **Electronic Games in Q2 (-$1,711)** saw major losses.
   - Assess whether these products **had high return rates, pricing issues, or seasonal demand declines**.

8. **Identify Pricing Trends for Consistently Profitable Products**
   - **Printers performed well in Q1 and Q4**, showing **consistent profitability**.
   - Consider whether **marketing efforts or price adjustments** contributed to strong sales.

9. **Compare Seasonal Trends in High vs. Low Profitability Products**
   - Investigate whether **high-margin products (Printers, Bookcases) are promoted during profitable quarters**.
   - Analyze whether **low-performing products are being overstocked or discounted too aggressively**.

# Monthly & Quarterly Sales Analysis

## **Final Insights & Actionable Steps**
1. **Discontinue or adjust pricing for unprofitable product types.**  
   - **Electronic Games and Phones consistently resulted in losses.**  
   - **Assess if discounts or return rates are causing these losses.**  

2. **Leverage high-performing sub-categories.**  
   - **Printers and Bookcases had high sales and profitability.**  
   - **Increasing inventory or marketing these items could drive further growth.**  

3. **Address negative profit drivers.**  
   - **Sarees had high sales but major lossesâ€”analyze if returns or cost structures are the issue.**  
   - **If losses are due to discounts, consider adjusting pricing strategies.**  

4. **Reevaluate inventory for lowest-selling product types.**  
   - **Skirts, Leggings, and Kurti had the lowest sales and profitability.**  
   - **Determine if they should be discontinued or adjusted for higher demand.**  


5. **Electronics drives high revenue but requires profit optimization.**  
   - Examine pricing and return policies to ensure profitability in low-performing months.  
   - Focus on high-margin electronic products like **Printers** instead of loss-generating ones like **Phones**.  

6. **Clothing has strong sales but needs a refined profitability strategy.**  
   - Reduce discounting in historically weak months (**June, September**).  
   - Identify which clothing products contribute most to net profits and prioritize them in marketing efforts.  

7. **Furniture, despite lower sales, maintains stability.**  
   - Consider whether increasing **high-margin furniture items like Bookcases** could improve revenue.  
   - Assess demand elasticityâ€”do customers buy more when prices are reduced?  

8. **Identify why certain months have sharp losses.**  
   - **May, July, and September show the worst losses.**  
   - Further investigation needed into **inventory costs, refund rates, and seasonal demand drops.**  

9. **Expand profitable product lines based on top-performing sub-categories.**  
   - **Printers and Bookcases** generated consistent profits and should be further promoted.  
   - **Loss-making products like Phones and Electronic Games should be reevaluated** to determine if they should be discontinued or repriced.

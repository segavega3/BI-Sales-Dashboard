# E-commerce Sales Analysis with SQL & Tableau Public

## ASK Phase: Business Problem and Analytical Goals

### Project Objective
This project aims to develop an **interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** using **Tableau Public** to help an e-commerce business track **sales performance, revenue trends, and customer behavior**.  

By leveraging **SQL for data extraction and transformation** and **Tableau for visualization**, the dashboard will provide **actionable insights** to optimize business strategies.

## Dataset Overview
This project uses an **online sales dataset** sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samruddhi4040/online-sales-data?select=Orders.csv)**.  
It contains **customer orders and transaction details** from **all 12 months of 2018**.

### Dataset Summary
| **Table Name**    | **Rows** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------|----------------|
| **orders**       | 500     | Customer & order metadata (who, when, where). |
| **order_details** | 1500    | Transaction details (what was sold, how much, payment type). |

**License:** CC0: Public Domain  

---

## Database Schema
The dataset follows a **one-to-many relationship** between the `orders` and `order_details` tables:
- **`Order ID`** is the **Primary Key (PK)** in both tables.
- The **`orders` table** contains order **metadata**.
- The **`order_details` table** contains **sales and transaction details**.

### Orders Table
```sql

| Column Name   | Data Type | Description                 |
+---------------+----------+-------------------------------+
| Order ID      | STRING   | Primary Key, unique order identifier. |
| Order Date    | DATE     | Date the order was placed.  |
| CustomerName  | STRING   | Name of the customer.       |
| State         | STRING   | State where the order was placed. |
| City          | STRING   | City where the order was placed. |
+---------------+----------+-------------------------------+
```
### Orders Table
```sql
+---------------+----------+---------------------------------+
| Column Name   | Data Type | Description                   |
+---------------+----------+---------------------------------+
| Order ID      | STRING   | Foreign Key, links to orders.Order ID. |
| Amount        | INT64    | Total revenue from the order.  |
| Profit        | INT64    | Profit from the order.        |
| Quantity      | INT64    | Number of items purchased.   |
| Category      | STRING   | General product category (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture). |
| Sub-Category  | STRING   | Specific product type within a category. |
| PaymentMode   | STRING   | Payment method (COD, UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card, EMI). |
+---------------+----------+---------------------------------+
```
## Data Exploration & Key Insights

### Orders Table Insights
- **25 distinct cities** across **19 states**.
- **336 unique customers**, with **107 customers appearing more than once**.
- **307 distinct order dates**â€”further validation required to ensure completeness.
- **500 distinct `Order ID`s**, all present in both tables.

#### Analysis Test:
- How many **distinct `Order ID`s** are associated with the **336 customers**?
- Do duplicate `Order ID`s on the same day indicate **multi-item purchases**?

### Order Details Table Insights
- **3 main product categories**: Clothing, Electronics, Furniture.
- **17 total sub-categories**, distributed as:
  - **Furniture:** 4 sub-categories.
  - **Clothing:** 9 sub-categories.
  - **Electronics:** 4 sub-categories.
- **1500 total order entries but only 500 distinct `Order ID`s**, suggesting multiple items per order.
- **5 payment methods**: COD, UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card, EMI.

#### Analysis Test:
- Validate that **all 500 `Order ID`s in `order_details` match the 500 IDs in `orders`**.

  - **Premium-priced products or reduced discounting strategies.**
  - **High-margin categories dominated sales** (Electronics and Furniture).
- **January had the highest sales ($61,632) but a lower profit share (26.2%)**, possibly due to:
  - **High holiday discounts or promotional campaigns.**

### **Observations**
- **May was the least profitable month (-10.09% profit loss)**, suggesting:
  - **Excessive discounting or clearance sales.**
  - **High return rates or defective products.**
- **July had the lowest revenue ($12,966) and a significant loss (-$2,138)**, indicating:
  - **Low seasonal demand.**
  - **A high percentage of low-margin products sold.**
- **December had strong sales but still ended in negative profit (-$1,604)**, suggesting:
  - **Holiday promotions eroded margins.**
  - **Increased operational costs or shipping expenses.**
- **June had minimal profit ($420) despite moderate sales ($23,658)**, meaning:
  - **Profitability was squeezed by potential high costs of goods sold.**
  - **This could indicate a category with high variable costs or increased returns.**

### **Observations**
- **Maharashtra had the highest absolute negative profit (-$9,434)** but also the highest **positive profit ($16,397)**, meaning:
  - The state had **high-volume transactions** but a **significant portion of unprofitable orders**.
  - The issue could stem from **high return rates, fraud, or regional pricing strategies**.
- **Madhya Pradesh had a similar pattern**, indicating **regional differences in profitability strategies**.
- **Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh had significantly lower transaction volumes but still showed negative profitability**, suggesting that:
  - **Operational inefficiencies (e.g., logistics costs) could be affecting profits.**
  - **Product demand in these states may be inconsistent.**

- **Q1 had the strongest profit performance, possibly due to strong January sales.**

---

## **Final Insights & Actionable Steps**

### **1. Investigate High Negative Profits in Q2 and Q3**
- Identify **specific products, categories, or discount strategies** contributing to losses.
- Were **pricing errors, excessive markdowns, or refunds** impacting margins?

### **2. Analyze December's Negative Profit Margin Despite High Sales**
- Did **holiday discounts** reduce overall profitability?
- Were **high-cost, low-margin products** disproportionately sold?

### **3. Optimize Clothing Profitability Across Quarters**
- Clothing showed **negative profits in Q2 and Q3** despite moderate sales.
- Consider **reducing markdowns** or adjusting pricing for **high-cost, low-profit items**.

### **4. Leverage Electronics as a High-Performing Category**
- **Electronics had the highest profits in Q1 and Q4**, suggesting **seasonal demand spikes**.
- Further analyze **which specific products contributed most** to profitability.

### **5. Investigate Poor-Performing Product Types**
- **Phones in Q3 (-$2,114)** and **Electronic Games in Q2 (-$1,711)** were major loss drivers.
- Assess whether these items had **high return rates, pricing issues, or seasonal demand declines**.

### **6. Compare Seasonal Trends in High vs. Low Profitability Products**
- Are **high-margin products (Printers, Bookcases)** actively promoted during profitable quarters?
- Are **low-performing products** being **overstocked or discounted too aggressively**?

### **7. Further Investigate States with High Negative Profit Orders**
- Should **regional pricing adjustments** be made?
- Are **certain cities consistently unprofitable**, and why?

### **8. Refine Pricing Strategies Based on Product Performance**
- Identify **consistent best-selling, high-margin products** to prioritize promotions.
- Phase out **low-margin, high-return products** to reduce financial inefficiencies.
